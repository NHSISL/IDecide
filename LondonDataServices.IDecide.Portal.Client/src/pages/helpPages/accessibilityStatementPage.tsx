                    <p>
                        This accessibility statement applies to the <strong>optout.dataservice.london.nhs.uk</strong> website.

                        This website is run by NHS OneLondon. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means that you should be able to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>zoom in up to 200% and on all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)</li>
                        <li>see text buttons &amp; links with an appropriate contrast including a visible focus outline</li>
                        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
                        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA, ChromeVox and VoiceOver)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
                    </p>
